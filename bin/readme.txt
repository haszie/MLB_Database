README.TXT:

Everything should work fine. Experienced some issues with reading in some files
that I could not figure out why it was not working. All the player's will import
ok but the offsets might now match and all the info might not be there, but for
the most part it works perfectly. 

Also note that my hashtable has been modifed to work specifically with this 
assignment. It cannot remove any data as this was not neccassary to implement. 
Look at the comments at the beggininng of hashtable.java for more info.
